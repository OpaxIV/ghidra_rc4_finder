_Before you begin:_ <br/>
NetworkX is needed for this script to work (version 1.10 or lower, since greater versions only support python 3.XX) <br/>
Ghidra supports Python 2.7.X

_Installation Instructions:_ <br/>
Install python 2.7.XX (we used 2.7.15) <br/>
Using powershell (on Windows), input 'pip install networkx==1.10' <br/>
After the Installation, copy everything from the folder "C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages" into your Ghidra Scripts Folder.
